- **Libraries:** STL (Standard Template Library)

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-classwork.git
   ```
2. Compile and run a C++ file:
   ```sh
   g++ filename.cpp -o output && ./output
   ```

## 📌 Notes
- Each folder contains **well-commented** source code files.
- Some assignments include **README** files explaining the problem statement and approach.

📝 **This repository showcases my understanding of C++ programming and problem-solving skills.**
